# EchoMind 🎙️  

**Conversational AI with Generative Intelligence & Realistic Speech Synthesis**  

## 🚀 About EchoMind  
EchoMind is an **AI-powered voice assistant** that **combines generative AI and text-to-speech (TTS) technology**. Unlike standard TTS applications that merely convert text into speech, **EchoMind first generates intelligent responses** using the **Groq LLM model**, then **synthesizes speech using ElevenLabs**, delivering a highly **interactive and natural-sounding AI experience**.  

## 🔗 Live Demo  
[Vercel Deployment Link](#) _(Coming Soon)_  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **User asks a question or provides input** in the chat interface.  
2. **Groq LLM processes the input** and generates a relevant response.  
3. **The response text is sent to ElevenLabs TTS**, which converts it into **high-quality speech**.  
4. **Frontend receives the speech as a Blob** and plays it instantly.  

## 🎯 Why EchoMind is Unique  
✅ **Hybrid AI model** combining **LLM intelligence + advanced speech synthesis**.  
✅ **Seamless, real-time AI voice responses** (not just text-to-speech).  
✅ **Supports multiple voice tones** (e.g., Formal, Sarcastic, Excited, Robotic).  
✅ **Highly scalable** – can be integrated into **voice assistants, customer support bots, or accessibility tools**.  

## What problem does it solve?
Traditional **TTS models are static** — they don’t "think." AI chatbots, on the other hand, **lack natural voice responses**. **EchoMind bridges this gap** by combining both, making it a **hybrid AI assistant** that can:  
- **Answer questions naturally**  
- **Support users with disabilities (accessibility use case)**  
- **Enhance virtual assistants and customer support systems**  

## Future scope 
- **Real-time streaming voice output** (WebSockets instead of Blob playback).  
- **A mobile-friendly UI** for a more seamless experience.  
- **Multi-language support** (since ElevenLabs supports multiple languages).

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Groq LLM** - Generates intelligent responses before TTS.  
- **ElevenLabs TTS** - Converts AI-generated responses into lifelike speech.  
- **Node.js + Express.js** - Backend API for AI integration.  
- **React + Tailwind CSS** - Frontend for user interaction.
